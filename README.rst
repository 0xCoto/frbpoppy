Conduct Fast Radio Burst Population Synthesis | **David Gardenier** | ASTRON

****************
What's frbpoppy?
****************
Establishing the origin and properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is one of the biggest goals in radio astronomy. ``frbpoppy`` was called into life to help astronomers determine which FRB properties to expect. Designed to be simple in use and easy to adapt, ``frbpoppy`` continues the work of ``psrpop`` and ``psrpoppy`` in the realm of FRBs.

*********************
How can I install it?
*********************
1. Get the files from the github repository:
   ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/davidgardenier/frbpoppy


.. note:: The following step is still under construction. Currently frbpoppy can be installed on Ubuntu by running
   ::

    $ python3 setup.py


2. Install it on your system:
   ::

    $ python setup.py install
