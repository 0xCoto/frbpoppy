Conduct Fast Radio Burst Population Synthesis | **David Gardenier** | ASTRON | |Build Status Master| | |Coverage Status Master| |

****************
What's frbpoppy?
****************
Establishing the origin and properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is one of the biggest goals in radio astronomy. ``frbpoppy`` was called into life to help astronomers determine which FRB properties to expect. Designed to be simple in use and easy to adapt, ``frbpoppy`` continues the work of ``psrpop`` and ``psrpoppy`` in the realm of FRBs.

*********************
How can I install it?
*********************
1. Get the files from the github repository:
   ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/davidgardenier/frbpoppy

2. Install it on your system:
   ::

    $ python setup.py install


******************
How do I use it?
******************
Well, that's where things get more interesting.
