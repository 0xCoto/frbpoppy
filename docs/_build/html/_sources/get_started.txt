What to do?
***********
This website is being built to guide beginners in the use of frbpoppy. If you've come this far - you must be an expert! If you arrived here wanting to dig deeper into frbpoppy, you might find the `github repository <https://github.com/davidgardenier/frbpoppy>`_ to be of help. All code should be well documented, and if there's something amiss, just `open an issue <https://github.com/davidgardenier/frbpoppy/issues/new>`_ or `drop me a note <gardenier@astron.nl>`_!
